- Prefer named exports over default exports
- Use `cn()` utility for conditional class merging with Tailwind
- Implement error boundaries at appropriate route levels
- Use Zod for runtime validation and type inference
- Follow conventional commits for Git messages
- Structure components with props interface first
- Use React Router conventions (loader, action, meta exports)
- Implement progressive enhancement for forms
- Keep components focused and composable
